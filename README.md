# Course Project: Comparing Rectifier Performance

# Course: Deep Learning Graduate Course, Boise State University

The goal of this course is to prepare graduate students for research and research-level writing.  As such, very little instruction or guidance was given on Deep Neural Networks and how to research them.  I took this class out of interest and a love for research.

Recent work in the literature shows that viable alternatives to the ReLU activation function exist for speech recognition problems.  However, little work has been done to understand what alternatives there are to ReLU for pattern recognition problems.  The work in this repository is an attempt to begin to understand the importance of these alternatives for patter recognition.
